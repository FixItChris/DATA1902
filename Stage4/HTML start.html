<p style="font-family: Segoe UI">This report is aimed at those who are interested in various IT approaches for data analytical purposes. One of the most effective IT tools we have is data visualisation. Some of the many benefits of visualising  data include making the information that we intend to convey more audience-friendly in terms of the approach and understanding, as well as engaging. Such is done in accordance with Shneiderman's '8 Golden Rules of Interface Design'.
    Here, our team of four members visualised interesting aspects of different datasets pertaining to tertiary education success, and we will be discussing the advantages and disadvantages of the visualisation methods we used. In doing so, we hope that the reader can gain an insightful view as to (1) what ways of visualising out there is, and (2) the practical insight as to how one would go about using similar approaches to apply to their own data analysis in the future.
