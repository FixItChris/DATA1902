## Running of Visualisations
CMOR5434's visualisation uses a callback loop for the user to be able to update which x, y and colour
variables are being shown on screen.
Thus, to run CMOR5434's visualisation, the user needs to call

bokeh serve 520419832.py

from within the 520419832 folder and leave it running for the duration of viewing the website.

Each of the interactive visualisations can be accessed by clicking on the links from the homepage.
